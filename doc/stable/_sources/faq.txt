# Frequently Asked Questions


## 1. Deployement

### 1.a Parallel processing

The options used to start the FreeDiscovery server are defined in `scripts/run_api.py`. By default, the options `processes=1, threaded=True` are used, which allows to run on all platforms, but disables parallel processing in FreeDiscovery.

On Linux, Mac or when running in a Docker container (including on Windows), a more efficient approach is to set `processes=4, threaded=False` (e.g. to run on 4 CPU cores), before starting the server (or before building the Docker container), which would allow parallel hashed feature extraction and cross validations.


## 2. Categrorization (ML or LSI)
### 2.a Feature extraction

The option `use_hashing=True` must be set for the feature extraction. Recommended options also include, `use_idf=1, sublinear_tf=0, binary=0`.

### 2.b Machine learning categorization methods

The cross validated logistic regression (with `cv=1`) is the advised method for use in production. 

The `xgboost-0.4` library cannot currently be easily installed on Windows, and the corresponding categorization method are disabled on this OS.

### 2.c LSI categorization methods

The recommended value for the `n_components` (dimensions of the SVD decompositions) is in the [100, 200] range.

## 3. Clustering 

### 3.a Feature extraction

The option `use_hashing=False` must be set for the feature extraction. Recommended options also include, `use_idf=1, sublinear_tf=0, binary=0`.

### 3. Hierarchical clustering

The Ward Hierarchical clustering is generally slower that K-mean, however the run time can be reduced by decreasing the following parameters,

   - `lsi_components`: the number of dimensions used for the Latent Semantic Indexing decomposition (e.g. from 150 to 50)
   - `n_neighbors`:  the number of neighbors used to construct the connectivity (e.g. from 10 to 5)
